         <p>Through our new Pay It Forward program, people have the opportunity to take it a step further. You can either purchase a planner (at a discounted rate) for someone in need or pledge to receive a planner for free if you cannot afford one.</p>

         <p>Here's how it works:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Someone who cannot afford a planner signs a pledge to become a potential recipient here.</li>

               <li>A sponsor buys a planner at a discounted price for a recipient. (Passion Planner will take care of shipping costs!)</li>

               <li>Recipient gets a planner with his or her sponsor's name and email address</li>

               <li>Recipient will then send a thank you letter at the beginning and end of the year.</li>

               <li>The recipient is encouraged to become a future sponsor.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I believe in this program so much that I will match the first 500 sponsorships, meaning you will be sponsoring 2 people for the price of one.</p>
