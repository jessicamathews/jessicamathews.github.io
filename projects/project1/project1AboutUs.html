         <p>Analysis paralysis. That was the feeling that spiraled me into a strange, post-grad depression and the problem that I wanted to help people overcome.</p>

         <p>I decided to make a tool that helped people clearly define their personal goals and dreams and put them at the forefront of their attention, and a planner was PERFECT for this. Passion Planner helps people break down their long and short terms goals into more actionable steps and gives them a place to incorporate these steps into their daily lives.</p>

         <p>I wanted people to use this planner as a compass they could use to guide their daily decisions. It's simple. You ask yourself: is what I am going to do today going to get me closer to my goals? Yes? Do it. No? Don't do it.</p>

         <p>I wanted to make a tool that encouraged people not only to start thinking about their goals, but make taking action towards them a part of their daily lives. And that's how Passion Planner was born.</p>
