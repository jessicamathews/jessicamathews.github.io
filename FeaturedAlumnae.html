               <li class="description">I currently live in Ft. Greene, Brooklyn with three King's alum and work at Success Academy Charter Schools. Success Academy is a network of 32 charter schools in the city fighting for education reform and equal opportunity for all New York City kids. I am an associate teacher in a kindergarten classroom at SA Union Square and am training to be a lead teacher next year. <br><br>

               I did not know I would be teaching when I graduated from King's, and I don't know if I will make a career of it. But I knew I wanted to work with and for people. I have a passion for the education movement because I think nothing sets us up for success in life as much as a strong education.<br><br>

               My piece of advice for the members is of QE1 is to have a GROWTH MINDSET about yourself! You're in the city of opportunity--don't be afraid to try new things, whether it's in the form of a club at King's, a part-time job, volunteer work, a hobby, or a super impressive internship. You might not know what you're good at yet or what kind of work lights a fire under you. You'll be a better person for trying and you will have a really good idea of what you want to keep doing when you graduate. </li>
