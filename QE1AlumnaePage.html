               <li> "QE1 means kinship to me. In the house I found so many kindred spirits among the girls. QE1 means never having to do the city alone, always having someone at your side, and each girl acts as a compass pointing each other to Christ through true friendship." -Hayley Bouffard</li>

               <li class="description">I had the opportunity to grab coffee with Grace Santulli and hear about what she has been doing! Grace is happily married to Brandon Santulli and living in the Upper East Side and absolutely loving it! Grace is going to be our Alumnae Representative, getting in touch with and communicating with our graduated Queens when needed.<br><br>

               Grace is currently the Promotions Manager at Salem Media of New York, a Conservative Christian radio talk station. As her position is relatively new, Grace ends up getting involved in a lot of different projects. As the Promotions Manager, she goes to different concerts and events to promote the station, runs social media, maintains their web presence, and plans events, such as Pastor Appreciation Month.<br><br>

               Grace's advice to current Queens is to take advantage of your flexible schedule. Free afternoons between classes is an opportunity you will never have again once you join the workforce. Take advantage of the city during your spare time, because soon you will only have evenings to enjoy it.<br><br>
