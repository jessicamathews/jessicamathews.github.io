               <li class="description">I grabbed lunch with Celina last week and got to catch up with her and hear about what she has been doing! Celina is living in the city and currently working as an Editorial Fellow at the National Review Magazine, the oldest conservative publication in America. She pitches new story ideas every morning, edits online articles, and assists journalists. Celina speaks highly of her coworkers and the careful thought that goes into everything they do. Along with the National Review, she is also working part-time at First Things, a journal aiming to advance a religiously informed public philosophy.<br><br>

               For anyone considering going into Journalism, she suggests that you write for the school newspaper and get involved in Conservative Christian groups that can give you compensation for internships. Find a way to get to know people in your field. She never really liked the idea of networking until she found something she really loved doing, and then it turned out to be something natural and easy.<br><br>

               Celina has two pieces of advice to give us undergraduates here at King's. First, realize that every story is different. Your route will look different than someone else's. God teaches us through our own experiences. Don't try to model your life too much after others, but listen to their advice. <br> Second, you will be tempted to feel like you're at the top as you get older and become a senior. You're about to get your degree. You're about to head out into the labor force. But don't think of it as a capstone. A degree is only a basic foundation. In just a moment, you are going to be at the bottom again. You are going to be the one who has no experience. So, be humble. Don't take yourself too seriously, and make sure to listen to those who have been doing what you're doing for a long time before you. Be grounded in your fundamental values, but be open to new ways of thinking and do not be afraid to change. Also, do not be depressed about having a menial job. Your journey has just begun!<br><br>
