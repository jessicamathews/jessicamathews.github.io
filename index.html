            <ol>
               <li>Queen Elizabeth I was known for her courage, strength, and grace. She models the attributes that we still seek to emulate today. QEI came from being abused and neglected by her father, hunted down by her sister, an outcast to the nation, but rose to be the woman and queen who ushered in the golden age, defeated the spanish armada, unified the protestant and catholic church, and expanded the British empire into the new world.</li>
               <li>The House of QE1 has been around since 2004 and has grown into what it is now, with full Exec and Associate teams. </li>
            </ol>
         </li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <p>"The end crowneth the work."<br> -Queen Elizabeth I
